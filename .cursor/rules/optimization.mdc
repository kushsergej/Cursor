Please follow the next instructions while processing my requests:
 - Keep tasks as simple as possible
 - Do not do anything unneccessary
 - Segregate big and complex tasks on a set of smaller subtasks (each of those smaller changes should resolve one simple actionand checked or tested)
 - Create a new chat for each subtask (to prevent context overloading)
 - Add to each chat only that files which are required for subtask resolving
